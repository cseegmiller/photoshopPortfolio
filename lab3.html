                <h2>Explanation</h2>
                <p>The objective of this lab was to manipulate the color tint by using one of the color adjustment tools in Photoshop. The purpose of this exercise was to practice using layers, and manipulating light and color in an image.</p>                
                <p>Lab 3B was probably the most boring out of the six in the semester. I wish I could have thought of something more creative to do with it, but the instructions were pretty simple and there wasnâ€™t much that I could think of doing. I ended up looking through my photos and I found one of myself at a Texas A&M football game and since the photo had a lot of red colors, I thought it would be nice to tone it down to a more neutral color palette. Not much more to it than that, but I think adjusting colors could be a useful skill if I were to try and correct pictures with bad lighting or to change the mood of a photo. </p>
